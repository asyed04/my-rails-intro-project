# My Rails Intro Project

## Overview
This project is a **Football League Management System** built using **Ruby on Rails**. It allows users to explore **football leagues, teams, and players**, along with their statistics and history. The project includes features such as **search functionality, hierarchical navigation, pagination, and an interactive map** to visualize league locations.

## Features Implemented (Based on Grading Rubric)

### **1. Database & Models (ERD & Associations)**

#### **1.1 Describe Datasets (3 pts)**
The project uses **three datasets**:
1. **CSV Dataset** â€“ Contains league data (name, country, number of teams)
2. **Faker-generated Data** â€“ Creates teams and players with realistic names, positions, and statistics.
3. **External API Data** â€“ Fetches real player data from the SportsDB API.

#### **1.2 Database ERD (5 pts)**
A detailed **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** is created, illustrating the relationships between `Leagues`, `Teams`, `Players`, and `PlayerTransfers`.

#### **1.3 ActiveRecord Models (8 pts)**
The project includes **four models**:
- `League`: Represents football leagues.
- `Team`: Belongs to a league and has multiple players.
- `Player`: Belongs to multiple teams (through `PlayerTransfer`).
- `PlayerTransfer`: Tracks player transfers between teams (Many-to-Many relationship).

#### **1.4-1.5 Associations (8 pts)**
- **One-to-Many Associations:**
  - `League has_many Teams`
  - `Team has_many Players`
- **Many-to-Many Association:**
  - `Player has_many Teams through PlayerTransfers`

#### **1.6 Validations (5 pts)**
Implemented validations for presence, uniqueness, and numerical values:
- `Player`: Validates `name`, `age` (between 18-40), `goals_scored` (>= 0)
- `Team`: Validates `name` (unique within a league)
- `League`: Validates `name` (unique)

#### **1.7 Data Sources (8 pts)**
- **CSV (db/seeds.rb)** â€“ Populates the database with leagues.
- **Faker** â€“ Generates realistic teams and players.
- **API (SportsDB)** â€“ Fetches real player data.

- The project follows proper **HTML structure** and **valid ERB syntax**.

#### **5.2 ERB Conditional (3 pts)**
- Uses **ERB conditionals** to display **messages dynamically**, such as handling missing player data.
